## Inspiration
We noticed many of our friends and classmates struggle to find a quiet space to study, often with study rooms being occupied by individuals, this sometimes forces students to study in louder or .Therefore we want to increase room capacities for study spaces meanwhile encouraging mutual help in achieving efficient studying amongst ideal individuals.   

## What it does
Stroom allows users to search for the nearest place that identifies as possible places for quiet studying, such as Libraries, Colleges, and Universities. It also allows users to create posts to inform other fellow students if they will like a study buddy/study group. The user can specify the address of the building that they are in, the room number, how long they are using the room for, the subject that they are studying, and additional comments that they may like to add. This encourages more engagement amongst students while fully utilizing study spaces. 

## How we built it

Front-end: HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, Express.js
Back-end: Google API, MongoDB Compass/Atlas, Javascript, Node.js, Mongoose.
Git and GitHub 

## Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge we ran into was trying to connect our server with the MongoDB Compass/Atlas database as we weren’t very familiar with MongoDB. Countless hours of research and Trial & Error eventually paid off and at the end of the day, those hours turned into valuable skill sets we can use in the future. 
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of our integration of such frameworks and libraries such as Google API, Node.js, and MongoDB as we had little to no experience working with them. Nonetheless, we are proud that we challenged ourselves to step outside our comfort zones and try new skills that we weren’t familiar with. 

## What we learned
We learned a lot of technical skills, such as integrating databases and applying various frameworks. We also learned how to manage our time throughout the 24 hour hackathon, by tackling different parts of the project. This all contributed to us ending up with our final product.


## What's next for Stroom

We are continuing to be creative and unafraid to step outside our comfort zone to try something new. In the future, we plan on implementing a user profile and a searching network where users are able to find their ideal studying space with similar individuals by utilizing our tags system.
